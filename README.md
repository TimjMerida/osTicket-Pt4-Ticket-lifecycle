The first step in our post installation setup is to configure our roles. We will make a role called head admin that will be able do do anything we need to set up osTicket.
  
In osTicket we need to be in the admin panel. You can toggle between admin panel and agent panel on the top right. 
In the admin paned go to agents - roles and add a new role.
